### Description
 This is a Shiny App to show titanic survival statistics based on a combination of user inputs. This was a project initially from my introductory data science course that I enhanced after its conclusion. The application allows users to interact with input variables such as age, gender, and ticket class, showing the different factors in the survival rate aboard the Titanic. Through the reactive capabilities of Shiny, the application dynamically updates statistics and visualizations based on user selections. This project deepened my skills in R and data visualization techniques. As my first project using the Shiny platform, this introduced me to user interface design and reactive programming on the platform.
